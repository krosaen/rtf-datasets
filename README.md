============

some data dumps made made available from Real Time Farms

One is the entire NOP data set made available via http://apps.ams.usda.gov/nop but with lat/lon fields added.

The other is the list of farms on Real Time Farms that raise animals without the use of antibiotics (those you will see at http://www.realtimefarms.com/fixantibiotics).
