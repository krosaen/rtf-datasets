Pasture-raised poultry and grass-fed livestock, old breeds. Back Forty Acres is a family-owned farming venture whose vision is to produce good tasting meat and poultry products for the local community, raised naturally - on pasture and with natural feeds - humanely - done in a sustainable fashion.  Simple as that! 

Our animal feed has no chemicals, antibiotics or growth hormones.  Mother Nature does not feed these to her animals and humans were not meant to consume them through the food chain.  We believe mimicking Mother Nature can improve the quality of food and the quality of life.

Our animals are not confined as they are in many factory farms.  Our poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese) are raised on pasture in either portable pasture pens or in fenced in areas.  They are outside in the fresh air and sunshine.  Daily we move the pasture pens to a fresh new patch of green where they eat insects and grass, which we supplement with our natural feed.  Our egg layers are free range with 24/7 access to a large area we fence in with moveable fence.  Moveable so we can get them new grassy area.  Our sheep and goats are grass fed on 20+ acres.  The pigs are currently in the barn with 24/7 access to a paddock.  Soon they too will have their own corner of the pasture, where they can root around and just enjoy being a pig!  We also raise rabbit.  Outside living with access to proper foods can improve the quality of the meat and eggs along with the quality of the animal's life.

We raise several Heritage Breeds.  Have you heard this term? Factory farms generally raise only one type of chicken, pig, etc., focusing on a breed that will grow fast and cheap.  Because of this, many Heritage Breeds have populations that have dropped to a critical level. These ""old breeds"" of poultry and livestock are the ones our ancestors put on their tables. Rediscover them as many have across the country! You will be pleasantly surprised with the quality and flavor. Concerned breeders across the country are trying to build up their flocks and herds of Heritage breeds. With your purchase, you are saying that biodiversity is important.  We raise Tamworth pigs, Slate and Bourbon Red turkeys and Silver Appleyard ducks for their eggs.  Read more at www.backfortyacres.com",42.3180919,-84.0205029,www.backfortyacres.com,1,0,0

Providing chemical-free, nutritious, and delicious pork, beef, lamb, poultry, and eggs is our life goal, as we work humanely with our animals and in harmony with our land. 

Because we are committed to genetic diversity, we include endangered heirloom animals in our breeding stock and heirloom vegetables and grains whenever possible.  Never do we apply toxic pesticides, herbicides, chemicals, or fertilizers to our land.  On Crane Dance Farm, lush pasture, portable pens, fresh air, and sunshine nurture animals to thrive without the use of hormones, systemic biocides, or antibiotics. We believe that our farming philosophies and techniques (in stark contrast to the confinement life of factory farmed animals that are pumped full of chemicals and drugs to stay alive) are better for the earth, better for the animals, and, ultimately, better for the humans.

The vast majority of our ruminants, pigs, and poultry are bred, birthed/hatched, and raised on the farm, assuring quality control from breeding through processing.  We grind our own mineral-rich grains, most of which are grown by a certified organic farmer, and the remainder of which are purchased from local sources.  We avoid supporting any aspect of the industrial agricultural complex which would chemically infuse, genetically modify, and inhumanely treat and house animals.
Most important of all, we have the joy of wonderful, savvy customers who offer such affirmations as:
            ""You have the best pork chops on the planet,""  or

The Ranch is comprised of two properties in Siskiyou County near  the small communities of Grenada and Gazelle. Surrounded by vast conifer forests, the Shasta Valley lies in the shadow of magnificent Mt. Shasta, a Cascade Range volcano. Additional acreage is held in adjacent Lassen County. Blessed with an abundance of natural vegetation, water and natural beauty, the ranches  provide important habitat and sanctuary to a number of wild species. It is common to see migrating geese, swans, herons and Sand Hill cranes. Numerous raptors and many other bird, mammal, reptile and amphibian species make their homes here. Bald and Golden Eagles are frequent and revered guests on the Ranch. The Shasta River flows  through the Grenada Ranch property  and is critical habitat for the Coho Salmon. It is the family’s goal to maintain the natural balance of the Ranches so that it’s open space and wildlife are protected now and well into the future.

The ranches are the ongoing  life work  and commitment of Dr. Lowell Novy, a veterinarian, whose interests in conservation, cattle-ranching and animal welfare have informed his decision to turn away from “traditional” feedlot cattle production by developing an entirely grass-fed  program that is healthy for the land, cows and people.",34.2717979,-118.7824467,http://novyranches.com/,1,0,0

Our greenhouse produces certified organic plants in the spring, and our gardens are brimming with produce! We are small - only about a quarter of an acre garden - but use intensive gardening methods.

In the off-season, we get busy baking organic bread. French baguettes and hearty braided whole wheat, oat and nut loaves are our specialties. We do not have a certified inspected kitchen.

Our plants are raised in OMRI approved potting soil, we use organic seeds when available and if not, then no treated or GMO seeds. As for bugs, so far we have been lucky - by letting the bugs work things out for themselves, we are not destroying beneficial bugs and they do seem to stay pretty much in balance. We do hand pick potato bugs and take them to the chickens.

In addition to being Certified Organic, we use biodynamic organic farming practices (but are not certified). We apply BD-500 (made here on the farm with our own manure) in spring and fall. An organic dairy herd resides here, so we have plenty of access to organic manure. Mulching, composted manure and organic plants and seeds work together to produce excellent crops. Ruth Stout’s book, No Work Gardening, has had a great influence on my farming practices.

We grow over 50 different heirloom tomatoes, all different shapes, sizes, colors and flavors!

6307279,linden-dale-farm,Linden Dale Farm,"127 Herr Road, Ronks, PA","+The Farm-
Linden Dale Farm is a 93 acres preserved farm located in central Lancaster County.  It has been farmed by the Mellinger family for six generations.  Currently it is farmed by Andrew and Mary Mellinger and their six children, Andy Jr., Abram, Carrie, Greta, Madeline and Ezra.   There are currently 75 milking does and a slew of young goats.  All of the milk produced by the goats is used to make goat cheese.
The Goats-
They are Lamancha goats that were chosen for their gentle disposition and their excellent flavored milk. The goats are fed alfalfa grown on the farm and have access to pasture. Goats are browsers and enjoy eating many different plants and flowers too!  All responsibilities including milking, feeding, kid care, cheese making, and marketing of the cheese are shared by the whole family.  The whole process of milking the goats to making the cheese is located in one building therefore the milk is handled as little as possible maintaining the highest standard of quality and freshness of the milk. Six batches of cheese are made each week.
The Cheese- 
Linden Dale Farm makes a fresh chevre, feta cheese, fresh mozzarella, two soft aged cheeses: Laughing Lindy and Dalencay, and one hard cheese: Tomme de Lindendale. The milk is pasteurized in the vat at a low temperature so that its integrity is maintained, however, due to the Tomme’s ability to age for 60 days or more allows this cheese to be produced with raw milk.  All of the cheeses are sold at our farm stand at Lancaster Central Market and to local restaurants where they are featured in many menus. 
Chevre
This is a fresh cheese that acts as the staple goat cheese and can be used in practically all cooking recipes and salads as well as substituting for many of the generic processed cheeses with ease. Plain, chive, and garlic are offered as different flavorings but it is recommended that you season to your own liking as it can compliment many different spices. 
Feta
 The feta cheese is hand moulded in basket moulds to form individual wheels and then placed in brine,which is a combination of whey and salt water.  The feta wheels are then weighed and individually packaged so they can continue to age in brine.  Stored covered in brine in the refrigerator the cheese wheels will continue to mature and develop a more complex flavor over time.  The cheese can be stored like this for months.  The feta cheese is not too salty and has a pleasing finish. Made from goat milk this is a true feta and a healthy, flavorful addition to many dishes and salads. 
Mozzarella

This hand-pulled artisan cheese cannot be found anywhere else in the state and Lindendale Farms is one of the few producers that use goat milk to do so. Besides melting very well on pizza and other dishes, this cheese can be the capstone to a tomato-basil-mozzarella salad. The flavor is sweet and mellow and can be purchased dry-wrapped or wet in the brine. This cheese is only for sale seasonally.

Laughing Lindy
A French-style soft aged cheese that has a soft bloomy rind, this cheese can be delightful dinner-party sensation. This cheese is aged for 2-3 weeks in an aging cabinet before being hand-wrapped and taken to market. Finding a cheese with the unique pique and undertones in the flavor would be difficult on this side of the Atlantic. This is truly a cheese-lover’s delight on a cracker. 

Dalencay

Named after a similar looking cheese from the small French ville Valencay, the dark ash-coated rind of this cheese perks the curiosity of many a cheese monger.  Similar to Laughing Lindy, Dalencay can have a strong kick of flavor and smell but is surprisingly mild when paired with certain fresh fruit and bread. The exotic feel of tasting this pleasantly gooey cheese will keep you returning for more.

Tomme de Lindendale

This is the only truly hard cheese currently sold by Lindendale Farm. With a pure natural rind, tomme can be entirely eaten rind and all. Aged for at least 60 days this cheese can also be produced with raw milk which adds new flavors to the cheese. It has a sweet taste with a nutty finish making Tomme de Lindendale one of Linden Dale Farm’s most popular cheeses.",40.0008378,-76.1627343,,1,1,0

For this reason, for the past 35 years, we have been growing organic vegetables. Our farm was the first to be certified organic by the State of Colorado. The farm was instrumental with helping the State create the process in developing the law for State conducted organic certification. In 1953 Lewis Grant started farming in Colorado... 56 years it has now been!We started in a very small way as Lewis Grant, a Professor at Colorado State University, and his young son, Andy, began to grow vegetables in the 60s. This start proved to be the spark that created a passion in Andy for vegetable production that blossomed to the +2,000 acres we farm today. In 1974, Andy and Lew committed to transform our farm to the organic growing method.Their commitment at that time was revolutionary. Now,35 years later, we have become a national leader in the production of high quality Certified Organic Vegetables and Grains.We invite your neighbors in Colorado and Wyoming to be a part of our farm through our Community Supported Agriculture program.

6455008,fresh-pasture-farms,Fresh Pasture Farms,"1931 Kropp Rd, Millstadt, IL","Norm and Sandy Sutter have a history of farming since they were married nearly 33 years ago. Norm was a grain farmer when Sandy entered his life and she quickly became a farm wife as soon as they said, ""I do!"" Sandy had very little experience in production agriculture (let's say she was around the farm life from her aunt and uncle, but that's about it!). Norm was the one who had the background and education in the field (no pun intended).

Over the years as they worked and raised a family, agriculture was always a part of their life. They grain farmed, had a few cows (and even a few pigs once!), baled hay, etc. over the years. In the 1980's when many farms went out of business, finding that small-scale farming wasn't going to make it, Norm and Sandy hung on. As their family responsibilities grew, so did the farms. By 1990, with both of them working full-time off the farm, the tasks were becoming more time-consuming and costly to keep up.

In 1991 they sold all the grain equipment and simplified life to spend more time with their young family. It was at this time that Norm took Sandy to a cattle field day where they learned about Management Intensive Grazing. They came back to the family farm and immediately began planting grass, fence posts and running high tensile wire. The Stockman Grass Farmer, published by Allan Nation, was a regular piece of reading material, quickly replacing Prairie Farmer, Successful Farming and Progressive Farmer. By 1992 they were running stocker cattle, buying 300 - 400 lb. calves from the sale barn in the early part of the year, grazing them over the spring into the fall and then selling them at the sale barn, hopefully around the 800 lb. range.

There was a learning curve in this new adventure as they gained experience in raising grass and working with pasture rotation. Norm and Sandy attended numerous conferences over the years, learning and growing. One important learning point was having fresh water available to all paddocks (small pastures sectioned from the big pastures). They learned the importance of keeping cattle moving with a healthy balance of cattle stocking rate and achieving daily gains. Let's say not all years were great. Those became ""learning experiences!""

The nutritional part of the equation did not enter in until 2006 when Norm and Sandy were building a new home place on the family farm. Friends began asking about grass-fed beef. As stated earlier, this farm was a stocker operation, not a finishing operation. But the more people pressed in, asking about it and offering to buy it if it was produced, the more this deserved investigating. As Norm and Sandy were still in the design stages of the cattle barn anyway, they began reading more about grass-fed beef. Not sure if their acreage could produce enough grass to finish out beef raised solely on grass, they hired Jim Gerrish to spend the day consulting with them, offering ideas and suggestions as well as crunching some numbers on what they could produce and expect on their land. Jim suggested adding chickens and eggs to the land, but Sandy was reluctant to bring anything with feathers onto the property. However, that's where the story turns!

The more they learned about the nutritional benefits of animals on grass (who were after all, designed by God to be on grass), the more sense it made to work in harmony with nature than against it. By this time articles were regularly appearing in The Stockman Grass Farmer educating grass farmers about the benefits and conference agendas were reflecting this as well!

A severe ice storm on November 30, 2006 brought upwards of 50 trees down on existing fences. Norm and Sandy moved into their new farm home in January 2007. With loads of work ahead in designing facilities and now major repairs needing to be done to existing fences, moving forward would slow down. All by God's design, though. Based on all the interest in grass-fed beef, the working facilities were now designed to allow for all sizes of animals from small calves to fully grown cows or bulls; something originally not in the plans.

The next couple years were spent finishing up building the cattle lot and handling facilities, planting some new pasture and trying to sell their existing house. Remember at this time there was a housing crisis and major recession going on! Norm and Sandy also had two daughters get married during this time frame, one of whom held their wedding on the new farm!

By 2009, while continuing to educate themselves on the nutritional and health benefits of animals raised on grass, without hormones, antibiotics, etc. Norm and Sandy were joined in their efforts by their son, Wade and his girlfriend, Jaime. A new garden was planted, mostly organic seed and plants with no commercial fertilizers, pesticides or insecticides. They all began looking at lists of ingredients in foods at the stores, reading labels, and understanding the effects on the body from ingredients that cannot even be pronounced! It seemed every direction they turned more supporting information and confirmation was being found to continue in this pursuit of working with nature in according to God's design.

Wade, Jaime, Norm, Sandy along with some dedicated friends and family members worked all of 2009 putting up new fences and making repairs to the ice storm damaged ones. Pushing Wade to get finished with fencing were 12 cow-calf pairs that were being custom grazed on the farm. Wade began reading books written by Greg Judy, Jim Gerrish, and Joel Salatin. He began trying out the MOB grazing method described by Greg Judy. The Stockman Grass Farmer became a much anticipated monthly publication on the farm! A transformation was happening in the lives of the Sutter Family.

In the summer of 2009 talk began of attending a conference as Wade's interest grew in being an active part of the farm as opposed to working off the farm. They decided upon the Mid-Atlantic Grass-Finished Livestock Conference which included a tour of Polyface Farms in Swoope, VA. Wade was convinced they could add chickens to the farm and create a cash flow based off of Joel Salatin's model. Before committing to any of this, the Sutter's headed for Virginia.

After the conference, the direction was set. The Sutter's would add pastured chickens and pastured eggs to their cash grazing of beef cattle. Since the cow-calf pairs had been picked up by their owner in the fall, Wade ran an ad on Craig's List for winter grazing, something the Sutter's had never done before. This was a trial to see if this model would work on the farm as Greg Judy and Jim Gerrish talk about. Wade immediately received an email from a nearby farmer interested in bringing his cows here. It worked beautifully, even with one of the hardest winters in the St. Louis area in many years. From December to spring, the cows only spent a couple weeks here and there in the lot eating hay; otherwise they were on pastures, rotated every day!

Over the winter plans were made to launch a direct-marketing farm business where pastured eggs and chickens would be sold to the public. Fresh Pasture Farms, LLC would be the name as it describes so perfectly the vision for each animal on the farm. Every morning the chicks, chickens and cows are moved to a fresh pasture of grass where they receive a variety of grasses, sunshine, and non-medicated feed (for the chickens). Cows are only given fresh pasture unless weather conditions don't allow for them to be on grass in which case they are only given hay (no grain).

Fresh Pasture Farms, conveniently located 20 minutes southeast of downtown St. Louis, in the beautiful farm country of St. Clair County, IL, is now open Saturday mornings from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. for families to experience a real working pastured farm. Pastured eggs are now for sale. Orders are currently being taken for pastured broilers (chickens) that will be available over the summer. As the farm grows and customer demand increases, grass-fed beef and pastured pork will become available. The Sutter's look forward to meeting anyone interested in learning more.

Everyone is encouraged to investigate the source of their food and to buy locally. Be an educated consumer and know that there IS a difference on how your food is raised. It does affect the nutritional value (and your health) more than you know!",38.4704535,-90.1320934,www.freshpasturefarms.com,1,0,0

The farm wasn’t named until later on, when all three children were born.  That is where the name Three Arrows came from, one arrow for each child.   Our current logo (Elvira the orange cow)  was the first cow born on the farm while the Oak Ridge Boys song “Elvira” was playing on the radio so the name stuck.  Elvira lived on the farm her whole life (24yrs) and was the only orange cow in the herd of black Angus.  Today the farm is continued by Wells Shealy, Dr. Shealy’s youngest son

Currently, we raise 60 head of Registered Black Angus brood cows (mother) on 250 acres.  This means that in one years time we can potentially produce 60 calves for a total of 120 head.  Why Registered Black Angus?  Black Angus cattle are known for their superior carcass quality, providing you with the absolute best. In keeping our closed herd, it takes a tremendous amount of time to increase our size.  We would like,  over the next few years, to increase our herd size to 100 brood cows, so that we may produce more locally grown beef for you, our customers.   We treat our animals and land with the utmost respect as they are how we make our living.  We rotationally graze our pastures so that the land is not over worked and provides a constant supply of good forage for our cows.  We also produce our own hay on the farm so we are not introducing any foreign weeds, or unknown chemicals into our farm.

We handle our animals as humanely as possible, and it shows.  Our animals are very friendly towards us as we give them no reason to fear us.  We give them yearly vaccinations so that they are all in good health and we don’t have any sick animals and have no need to feed antibiotics to them.  We also select for superior genetics through our artificial breeding program, so that there is no need to give them any artificial growth hormones.

It all started with Tink's great grandfather back in the 1800's on his farm in central Florida. He believed in raising cattle the natural way - which happened to be the only way back then - before growth hormones, antibiotics and mass production. His way of farming was simple, natural and environmentally friendly. Good for people, good for the earth...it was a straightforward philosophy. That same honest care & commitment to the land & to the cattle that grazed that land, runs strong in Tink.

While she has always been involved in farm management & agricultural crops, it was not until she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the late 1990's that Tink began her own grass-fed operation. Tired of being overly medicated, Tink researched alternative ways to manage her illness and found an ideal solution in grass-fed beef. Grass fed was not a new concept to her, as her family had been doing it for hundreds of years, but it was a new mindset for Tink. The idea that she could manage her own illness through an all natural diet & farm fresh exercise, motivated her to explore all the nutritive benefits that a grass-fed beef diet could provide. Thanks to her grass-fed cows, Tink is now medication free & in control of her own health.

On her 230 acre farm, aptly named Lucky7W, in rural Wilkes County, Georgia, Tink has created a happy cow paradise. Lucky7W offers everything a black angus cow loves - sweet green grass, fresh air & plenty of room to roam. They wouldn't recognize a barn or a concrete pad if they saw it! Tink's cows spend all their time outside foraging in acres upon acres of rotating paddocks that offer plentiful shade trees, rolling hills and watering holes.",33.8152606,-82.7296484,http://www.tinksbeef.com/,1,0,0

Our beef is raised solely on the forage from our pastures – no grain, no antibiotics, no hormones, and no pesticides.  Every day our cattle get a fresh paddock of grass and fresh water from our springs and wells.  The result is a delicious and nutritious product that is superior to the supermarket beef: lower fat, lower calories, higher Omega-3’s, higher beta-carotene, and higher cancer fighting CLA’s.  Additionally, our grazing methods not only improve the health of our beef but also the land, increasing the fertility of the pastures.

Forest-fed Pork:

Our delicious forest fed pork comes from hogs which like all of our animals, live a far different life from their counterparts on industrial farms.  Our pigs’ diet includes sunshine, green grass, organic grains and rooting in the woods for acorns and tubers.  The natural diet of our pigs results in healthy and nutritional pork full of vitamins, minerals and good cholesterols not found in supermarket pork.

Free-range Eggs:

Our eggs are produced by our free range chickens that work in a symbiotic relationship with our cattle herd.  Our mobile chicken coop follows behind our cattle, rotating daily.  Each day our chickens roam the fields getting their fill of bugs and grass.  The result is beautiful eggs with a nutritious rich yolk and incredible flavor!

From the beginning, the new dairyman operated by the philosophy he and his family were ""stewards of the land,"" following environmentally sound waste management and soil conservation practices. Committed to quality, Ross believed in treating his all-jersey cows with care, not using artificial hormones* and in producing the finest dairy products possible.

The same core values are in force today as son Ricky Sparkman and his three sons Matthew, Ryan and Dustin begin a new phase in the life of the dairy with Sparkman's Cream Valley. Beginning in 2007, Sparkman's now offers a line of custom, high-quality dairy products in a new production facility right on the farm, using milk from their own cows.

Sparkman's plans to continue their ""quality first"" practice by purchasing local strawberries, blueberries, pecans and other local ingredients for their ice cream flavors.

Taste is what it is all about – and taste is a significant difference in the Sparkman Cream Valley dairy products. In fact, some folks have called the taste of our dairy products ""heavenly."" We appreciate the compliment! To answer those who wonder how we do it...well, here's our secret: we still maintain artificial hormone* free, all-jersey cows so the initial dairy product is of the highest quality – resulting in superior tasting milk, buttermilk, yogurt, butter and ice cream. That's it. Nothing fancy...just outrageously delicious dairy that will leave you asking for more.",31.179908,-83.7890631,http://sparkmanscreamvalley.com/,1,1,0

We are Mike and Deb Hansen, and along with our three children, we own and operate an 80 acre farm named ""Gifts From the Good Earth"" near the central Wisconsin community of Milladore. We strongly believe in the benefits of organic production and raise our grass-fed Belted Galloway beef cattle in methods that meet and exceed the National Organic Program standards. In 1998, we achieved organic certification and are currently certified by the Midwest Organic Services Association (MOSA).  Over the years, we have been innovative leaders in the pasture raising of Pasture-Raised Chickens and Turkeys, and have included Pastured Pork and lamb as well.

Good Earth Farms, (not to be confused with or family's farm ""Gifts From the Good Earth Farm"" is the culmination of years of friendships between our farm and five other organic pasture-raised farm families in Wisconsin.  Because time marches on, kids get older and move away, and life throws a curve ball at us once and a while, Good Earth Farms came into being so that we could continue to offer our friends and customers the humanely raised organic meats that they needed.

Our herds and flocks are grazed in an Intensive Rotational Grazing system to ensure that they are eating only from lush, tender pasture, which is grown from soils receiving only natural amendments such as compost, green manures and minerals. Because of this, we believe that you will find our meat to be a more pure, fresh and flavorful product than most.

Our beef and pork is processed in a USDA inspected butcher shop (Pete's Market) and packaged in easy to use portions. Our poultry is processed in a USDA inspected facility, packaged and frozen whole or in many different packaging options.

We purchased a pig from a local source to feed out.  It was some of the best pork we had ever tasted, and we knew exactly what we were eating because we had complete control over what our animals were fed.  

Then we decided if we were going to raise the best pork possible, we had to start with the best pigs possible.  We had plenty of space, and really wanted to go back to a different time when things were a lot more simplified, a lot less automated and a lot more natural.  Cramped, confined corrals of todays Commercial Pig Farmer did not appeal to us. 

We read everything we could find about grass feeding and pasture raising pigs.  We wanted our animals to be happy, healthy, and to have as much freedom as we could provide.  Around every corner we found the same answers - heritage breeds, such as Tamworth and Large Blacks.

These old breed pigs developed the skills needed to survive off of the land.  They love to graze on fresh grass during the summer months, and are equally happy with locally grown grains we provide as supplements.  

We never give any of our animals growth hormones, steroids or unnecessary antibiotics.  These are slow maturing animals, taking several months longer than standard market pigs to reach full maturity.

Our animals are treated with dignity, love and respect.  If you would like to take a tour of our farm, email us at: sotxhp@aol.com or info@southtexasheritagepork.com",29.1335781,-98.1561192,www.southtexasheritagepork.com,1,0,0

Our families passion for taking care of the animals and the land show in everything we do and the products we produce.
Caring for our land and animals in a way that makes us sustainable allows us to provide a product to our customers that we are pround to put our label on. Here at TMF we are a natural and sustainable farm. You may ask your self what is natural?
Natural is not a USDA certified program, however it does mean that we never add anything to our animals or our land that isn't all ready there. We NEVER use hormones or growth stimulants. Instead we allow our animals to grow naturally in a stress free enviroment with green pastures and hay. Our animals are truly cared for, living their lives free to roam on lush grass untill the day it is neccisary that they give their lives to feed our friends and neighbors. We know that by giving our critters the best possible life they in turn give us the best possible product. 
Our land is a criticle part of our lives. I some times hear the phrase ""farmers are just out to rape and pillage the land"", i ask you how can this be if i am going to make a home and a living for my family off of the land. Using sustainable practices such as crop rotation, intensive grazing, natural fertilization, criter rotation, and careful water management makes the land better and the animals happier. We are always looking to make ourselves more sustainable through better management and learning new ways to better care for the stewardship we have been blessed to have.

Taking a Holistic Approach to the management and production of high-quality foods and natural beauty, this team has slowly been building an infrastructure that looks at the “Whole” —history, environment, ecosystems, natural resources, social responsibilities,  economic viability, quality of life, personal values and sustainability for future generations—a working single organism.  Blending these different parts of the Whole together, our vision is to create a place that sustains itself, both in the short and long term, by producing nutrient-dense foods, aesthetic atmosphere, and providing quality of life for us and the greater community.
LoganBerry Heritage Farm is more than just a ‘sustainable’ Farm that employs basic organic growing standards.  We have immersed ourselves in the research of the world’s most successful methods of healthy food production that heals the land, builds soil and protects future resources.  We use a variety of those methods on the Farm such as Biological Ionization, No Till Straw Gardening,  Mob Stocking, Raised Bed Systems, Various Composting Methods, Earthworm Production, Permaculture Design, Cover Cropping, Ley Systems, Rotations of Both Plants and Animals, Hedgerows, Reforestation of Native Plant and Trees, Product Diversity, Riparian Naturalization, Soil Remineralization, just to name some.  We have also studied the methods of Newman Turner, Sir Albert Howard, Masanobu Fukuoka, Charles Walters and others who have paved the way for us to become the Stewards of the Land the way we are supposed to.
We save seeds, primarily ones from our Southern Appalachian area that have been handed down for generations.  We take the stand that saving seeds from these open-pollinated heirloom plant varieties is important for the future, believing that all humans on the Earth should have access to seeds that have not been modified in a lab in order to become the ‘property’ of  huge corporate conglomerates.  We do not support Genetically Modified Seeds (or foods from them) because it is adverse to laws of nature, as well as to the well-being of all mankind.
We sell our foods at our Farm Market, which is open from late spring till fall offering a variety of seasonal vegetables, with an emphasis on Appalachian Heritage Foods, fresh and dried Herbs, and fresh flowers.

Beyond Organic was founded based on this idea: That everyone should have access to the healthiest food and beverages on the planet. No longer would “grassfed” be solely the province of those lucky enough to be near a local farm or willing to drive to an out-of-the way store. For too long, healthy buzzwords like “organic” have belonged to the select few who can find it and afford it. Beyond Organic will change that. For the first time ever, the healthiest foods and beverages will be available to anyone, regardless of where—or how—they live.


Stretching across 8000 acres of pristine land in the Ozarks and continued among 140 acres of pure spring-fed mountain property in North Georgia, Beyond Organic is a new company on a mission to change your diet, change your life, and change your world.

Beyond Organic is the passion project of owner Jordan Rubin, who believes that we have lost our connection to the land. Where our ancestors used to drink water from unblemished springs and eat food they could grow themselves, today we rely on chemical-laden tap water and food processed to an unrecognizable form. Jordan’s vision is to alter that dynamic by reconnecting individuals to the ultimate source of health—food and water from land preserved by nature.

We are at the same latitude as the wine country of France.
It’s perfect for cheese goats!We feed only certified organic alfalfa and grass hay and practice rotational grazing, which means we move the goats from one pasture to another as they eat the grasses and clover down. They are able to pasture all year long, here in the Willamette Valley. 

The goats receive minerals, kelp, cider vinegar, nutritional yeast, molasses, bramble clippings, sunflower seeds, cod liver oil, and an occasional peanut.

We feed NO wheat products, so our cheeses are GLUTEN-FREE. 

The Animal Welfare Institute has inspected and certified our goat dairy as Animal Welfare Approved because of our livestock practices. We love our goats and enjoy giving them the very best, as well as allowing them to behave as goats deserve.For example, our pasture is pancake-flat, a lovely little piece of the Willamette Valley, but that meant we needed to pile dirt to make a little hill so the goats could engage in climbing and dominance behaviors. Herd ranking is important to goats, and they do a little head butting now and then to be sure their place is established in the herd hierarchy. It's about respect, we think. 

Young goats--the kids--are fed goat's milk, naturally, not soy-based milk replacers. We strive for a happy healthy herd, to make the best milk.",44.905485,-123.328507,http://fairviewfarmdairy.com/,1,0,0

help from our Border Collie, Socks, a pack of felines led by a large tomcat named Rascal, and four horses.

My wife and I are both natives of southeast Iowa and we have been involved in agriculture our entire lives; our children
represent the fifth generation of farmers on the land. Most of our livestock graze rich pasture nearly all of their lives.
We use no antibiotics, no hormone implants, no chemical fertilizers or herbicides on any of our pastures or produce.
As stewards of the land, we believe that nature provides the best pattern to follow to produce food for your table and
as a result we take a sustainable, non-industrial approach to this noble profession. Nature is all about diversity and pastured livestock and poultry allow us to heal the land, create healthy soil, and healthy food with nutritional superiority.

Anyone is welcome to visit our farm at any time. We love to use the farm as a classroom to teach as many visitors

As she was eating one of my gourmet burgers, she exclaimed, ""DeyDey you have the best beef ever!!!"" Nadine, my best half, and I immediately thought, wow that is the name we want to use. It says what we are about, high quality, healthy good tasting beef. That said, we also raise chickens. Our small farm is located in the Santa Rita Apellatia Wine area just west of Buellton. When we started we searched far and wide for those elements that create good beef. We start out with excellent genetics: Lowlines. Lowlines are a derivative of Angus, a breed well known for tenderness and marbling. Lowlines are 60% the size of Angus, finish/marble well on grass, are gentle and weather periods of drought and other natural stresses better than their larger counterparts. Add to that those grasses that make the cows taste good, IMF determination prior to harvest to insure our beef will grade ""Choice"" (USDA Quality Standard), low stress handling and transportation and vacuum packing and freezing for long lasting freshness and you have our quality program in a nutshell. We grow all the food for the cows ourselves (pastures and hay) and feed not grains, animal by products, or use antibiotics or hormones. You can visit us on our website for more information and locations where to obtain our beef. Our chicken is all organic and pasture raised.
